<h1 align="center">Zero Orbit</h1>

Zero Orbit is a personal study repository dedicated to foundational concepts in front-end web development. This project serves as a detailed log of my learning journey through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, structured around the "Front-End: Minha primeira página web!" course by Progra{M}aria. The site is designed as a single-page reference, written by a beginner for other beginners.

## Features

*   **Dynamic Table of Contents:** The summary section is automatically generated using JavaScript, creating navigable links to all major topics and sub-topics on the page for easy navigation.
*   **Comprehensive Notes:** Detailed explanations and code examples for core web development concepts, covering:
    *   **Internet:** How it works, datacenters, IP, TCP/IP, and DNS.
    *   **HTML:** Structure, tags, semantic elements, attributes, and best practices.
    *   **CSS:** Syntax, selectors, the Box Model, units, and color systems.
    *   **JavaScript:** DOM interaction, variables, data types, operators, and control structures.
*   **Responsive Design:** A clean, dark-themed interface that adapts to various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
*   **Interactive Feedback Form:** A functional contact form integrated with `formsubmit.co` that allows visitors to send feedback directly from the page.

## Tech Stack

*   **HTML5:** For structuring the content.
*   **CSS3:** For styling and layout, including a responsive design.
*   **JavaScript:** For dynamic functionality, including the table of contents generation and form submission handling.
